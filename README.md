## ðŸ“Œ**Definisi**
### ðŸ“’Cohort
cohort analysis adalah proses analisis yang bertujuan memahami perubahan *user engagement* dari waktu ke waktu

## ðŸ“Œ**Study Case**
### **User Retention Analysis for a Mobile App**

### ðŸ“’ Deskripsi Masalah:
A mobile app company wants to understand user retention patterns and identify strategies to improve user engagement and retention rates. The company aims to conduct a cohort analysis to analyze user behavior and identify the key factors that contribute to long-term user retention.

### ðŸ“’ Data dan Variabel:
The company has collected a dataset containing user information and their activities within the mobile app. The dataset includes information such as user registration date, user demographics, user activity metrics (e.g., app sessions, time spent in the app), and user churn status (whether the user has churned or is still active).

### ðŸ“’ Tujuan:
Perform cohort analysis to analyze user retention rates, identify behavioral patterns, and make recommendations for improving user retention.

### ðŸ“’ Langkah Analisis:
âœ… *Exploratory Data Analysis* (EDA):
1. Load the user dataset into the analysis environment.
2. Check the dimensions of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
3. Examine the first few rows to get a sense of the data structure and variables.

âœ… Cohort Creation:
1. Identify the cohort definition based on a specific event or timeframe (e.g., the month of user registration).
2. Assign users to their respective cohorts based on the defined criteria.
3. Calculate the cohort sizes to understand the distribution of users across cohorts.

âœ…Cohort Retention Analysis:
1. Calculate the retention rate for each cohort over time.
2. Create a retention matrix or retention curve to visualize the retention rates across different cohorts.
3. Identify any significant differences in retention rates among cohorts and investigate potential reasons for these differences.

âœ…Behavioral Analysis:
1. Analyze user behavior within each cohort, such as the number of app sessions, time spent in the app, or specific actions taken.
2. Compare the behavior patterns of retained users versus churned users within each cohort.
3. Identify any specific actions or behaviors that are strongly correlated with higher retention rates.

âœ…Time-Based Analysis:
1. Analyze user engagement and retention over time since registration within each cohort.
2. Calculate metrics such as average session frequency, average time spent, or the likelihood of churn at different time intervals.
3. Identify any critical time periods where user engagement or retention tends to drop.

âœ…Segment Analysis:
1. Segment the cohorts based on user demographics or other relevant variables.
2. Compare the retention rates and behavioral patterns among different segments.
3. Identify any specific segments that exhibit higher retention rates or unique behaviors.

âœ…Insights and Recommendations:
1. Summarize the key findings from the cohort analysis, including retention rates, behavioral patterns, and time-based trends.
2. Identify the key factors that contribute to long-term user retention.
3. Provide recommendations on strategies to improve user engagement and retention, such as personalized onboarding, targeted marketing campaigns, or feature enhancements based on the identified patterns.
4. By conducting a comprehensive cohort analysis, the mobile app company can gain insights into user retention patterns, identify areas for improvement, and develop data-driven strategies to enhance user engagement and increase long-term user retention.
